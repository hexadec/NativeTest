# NativeTest
A simple project to test the efficiency of C++ and native code using various aspects. 
This program is necessary to supply data for my EE.

> Do not gather test results created by the **debug** build variant in Android Studio!
> Due to various profiling and debug utilities, all run times *(especially native code)* are significantly slower
> than in **release** build variant, so use that!

> To provide a different kind of test environment, comment out usages of deleteCache()
